### Introduction to AI

- **Define artificial intelligence**: Foundation of AI. Teaches a machine to learn based on data
- **Understand AI-related terms**: Automatic error detection based on anomaly
- **Understand considerations for AI Engineers**: Interpretation of images and video
- **Understand considerations for responsible AI**:
- **Understand capabilities of Azure Machine Learning**
- **Understand capabilities of Azure AI Services**
- **Understand capabilities of the Azure Bot Service**
- **Understand capabilities of Azure Cognitive Search**


### Define AI

Definition: Software that exhibits one or more human like activity


### Understand AI-related terms

- **Automated ML (AutoML)**: Create effective ML models with no expertise needed
- **Azure ML Designer**: A GUI for no-code development of ML models
- **Data and Compute**: Cloud-based resources for data scientists tu run experiments
- **Pipelines**: A way to orchestrate tasks like training, validation, and deployment

### considerations for AI engineer

Definition: Analyzing data over time to identify unusual changes

### Understand considerations for responsible AI

Definition: Need for responsible and ethical development of AI systems

Core principles:

- Fairness: Systems should make predictions without bias to a single to specific groups
- Reliability & Safety: Comprehensive Testing & Deployment and application of thresholds regarding review criterion
- Privacy & Security: Protect data and customer content
- Inclusiveness: Obtain contributions to design, development and testing from diverse group
- Transparency: System should be understood by anyone (purpose, how it works, limitations)
- Accountability: Clearly defined Governance and organizational principles as a guide

### Understand Capabilities of Azure Machine Learning

Definition: Describe what features and capabilities azure ml has available

- autoML: non-experts can create effective ML from data
- az ML designer: gui no-code ml solutions
- data and compute mgmt: cloud-based compute and storage to run experiments
- pipelines: orchestrate model training, deployment, mgmt tasks

Use:
- DS: entire ML lifecycle - ingest and prep data, run experiments to explore and train models, deploy and manage as web service
- software engineer: autoML or designer as a REST service and integrate into AI-enabled solutions, collab with DS, SDK or CLI scripts manage versioning, deployment, testing of ML

### Understand Capabilities of Bot Services

Definition: Bot is a software agent engage in conversational activities
Development: Bot Framework SDK (code) or Bot Framework Composer (visual design interface)

- **Bias**: Trained data might rely heavily on specific race, or geography
- **Errors**: Mistakes can cause harm (e.g. autonomus vehicles)
- **Exposing data**: Non-compliant solutions that don't remove Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
- **Accessibility**: A solution might not work with individuals with disabilities
- **Complex systems**: Users must trust how solutions are generated (e.g. from what data)
- **Liability**:  Who/what is liable for decisions?

### Understand Capabilities of Azure Cognitive Services
Definition: Applied AI service to ingest and index data from multiple sources. Enables search of index to find, filter, and sort information

Enrichment Pipeline: enhances index with insights from source data

Knowledge Store: stores enrichment pipeline data and can be used analyzed or integrated into a decision intelligence solution
